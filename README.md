# PmagPy-Standalone-Linux
Pmag GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database. For more information on MagIC, see: http://earthref.org/MAGIC/. For complete documentation on using Pmag GUI, see: http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/

MagIC GUI, in contrast, provides tools for directly interfacing with MagIC tables, properly formating said tables, and creating files for upload to the MagIC database.

If you want to download the full PmagPy functionality, go to: https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy#what-is-it

To get started with the Linux standalone, download the compressed file and extract them. Then you should be able to double click whichever GUI you want to run and it will launch. Though due to constraints with the binary deployment you may have to wait for some time as the GUI starts (5-30 seconds).
